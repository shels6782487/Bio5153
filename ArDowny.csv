Mays was mostly full of water on Saturday --morning, but when we arrived yesterday, there were mudflats everywhere!  --There was also a significant influx of new shorebirds at Mays, compared --with what we saw on Saturday morning, and what was reported on Saturday --evening.  Most impressive of all was the presence of 18 BAIRD''S --SANDPIPERS, a total that equals the high count for New York State and --represents a new non-coastal maximum.  The Baird''s Sandpipers were mixed --in with numbers of LEAST, SEMIPALMATED, and PECTORAL SANDPIPERS, and --often afforded great views on the nearest mudflat to the right of the --coral.  Besides the big influx of new Baird''s, other new shorebird --arrivals in the past 24 hours included four SHORT-BILLED DOWITCHERS, three --STILT SANDPIPERS (with one still almost completely barred), one WILSON''S --SNIPE (formerly Common Snipe), and one molting adult BLACK-BELLIED --PLOVER.  GREATER YELLOWLEGS and LESSER YELLOWLEGS were both present, as --were KILLDEER, thirty SEMIPALMATED PLOVERS (~25 adults to 5 juveniles), --and one SPOTTED SANDPIPER.      --    As if these shorebirds weren''t enough, there was a LEAST BITTERN --extravaganza at Montezuma yesterday.  Our original group of six from --Ithaca did a quick trip through the Auto Loop, where, thanks to Mark --Chao''s excellent description, we were able to find three Least Bitterns --in the area across from marker 1 on the Auto Loop.  Two birds were --adults, while the third was a still-partially-downy juvenile bird.  Then, --almost as soon as we arrived at Mays, Mike spotted an immature --BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT-HERON, a GREEN HERON, and a LEAST BITTERN almost in a --row in the canal stretching from Mays Point Pool towards Tschache Pool.  --Eventually, I saw three different Least Bitterns, and I think somebody --might have seen a fourth.  Also in that area, Meena picked out a black --fluffball (this is one of Meena''s specialties) that turned out to be a --VIRGINIA RAIL chick.  Granted, all rail chicks are black fluffballs, but --we felt confident with that identification, since this black fluffball --was accompanied by first one, and then two, adult VIRGINIA RAILS.  --     Alas, before the McGowan boys and Gerard arrived, the seven of us --were treated to a show by a MERLIN that zoomed through Mays several --times.  Meena just made mention a few days ago to locating raptors by the --chatter of swallows in the area, and that was exactly how I first noticed --the presence of the Merlin.  We were eventually able to watch this bird --for an extended period of time (5 minutes?) as it chased after the --smallest shorebirds.  It seemed to have a single bird singled out and --away from the main flock a few times, but it was never successful in --actually catching anything.  Eventually, it was "escorted" out of the --area by a group of swallows.    --    The final highlight of the evening was a brief appearance of a --COMMON NIGHTHAWK flying over Mays at exactly 8 pm.  Because of a --relatively heavy cloud cover, it was fairly dark at this point, and the --13 GREAT EGRETS that had been in Mays had already left for their roosting --spot (which we decided was somewhere in the direction of Tschache Pool).  --Earlier in the evening, there were also 13 CASPIAN TERNS (including one --juvenile) at Mays.

I crossed the road, reentered Sapsucker Woods, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the Podell Boardwalk. At the Lab, stepped into the Morgens Observatory for a quick look at the pond and the Treman Bird-feeding Garden. I then stepped back outside, and continued north. I checked again (and again unsuccessfully) for Virginia Rail in the wetlands between the service entrance and the Lab parking lots. I entered the Lab at the staff entrance. Daylight Saving Time.

I entered the area around the Frog Barn, to the edge of the Frog Barn pond. From the Frog Barn, I walked through the woods along the southwestern segment of the East Trail to Sapsucker Woods Road, crossed the road, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the boardwalk. Water levels high under the boardwalk (higher, at least, than they've been so far this spring.)  At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden. I then went upstairs and viewed the pond again from the observatory on the second floor (between the library and the administration offices). Returning downstairs, I exited through the caterer's entrance, on the east side of the Lab, and continued north, entering the Lab again at the staff entrance at the northeast corner of the building.

Highlights included an Oystercatcher "drama" wherein the quite active chick was temporarily separated from its parents, who spent quite some time running up and down the path and vocalizing (as only AMOYs can do) until the eventual reunion.  One of the younger killdeer chicks was seen with the adults,  at some distance from  spraying activities in their usual area.  One osprey was seen on the platform, then gliding overhead.  More unusually, one of our sharper-eyed birders caught a brief look at three flying bobolinks before they disappeared into the Spartina.	heard only

I saw a glimpse of blue, and thinking it was a blue jay I casually pointed my binoculars at it. I then realized it was not a blue jay. Remembering from the previous times I have seen bluebirds, I realized it was a bluebird. I double checked with my guides and recorded this sighting on ebird.----I saw the bluebird on a low limb in a cluster of trees just south of Kissena Lake between a grassy hill and marshy area of phragmities.

I entered the area around the Frog Barn, to the edge of the Frog Barn pond. From the Frog Barn, I walked through the woods along the southwestern segment of the East Trail to Sapsucker Woods Road, crossed the road, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the boardwalk. At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden; I encountered Charles Eldermire, and spent some time talking to him. I then stepped back outside, and continued north, entering the Lab at the staff entrance at the northeast corner of the building. Tuesday. Eastern Daylight Saving Time.

Highlights included an Oystercatcher "drama" wherein the quite active chick was temporarily separated from its parents, who spent quite some time running up and down the path and vocalizing (as only AMOYs can do) until the eventual reunion.  One of the younger killdeer chicks was seen with the adults,  at some distance from  spraying activities in their usual area.  One osprey was seen on the platform, then gliding overhead.  More unusually, one of our sharper-eyed birders caught a brief look at three flying bobolinks before they disappeared into the Spartina.	heard only

Recent flooding forced us to backtrack instead of completing the loop as usual, but there were still many rewarding sightings. Today's highlights, though, were "off-list"--a most unusual bird later ID'd as a presumed escapee White-tailed Diamond Dove, and, for our second diamond, a Diamond-Backed Terrapin seen covering her nest in a wide spot in the gravel trail; DBT's are often seen in the marsh and basking, but none of us had ever encountered one nesting at this location.  Lots of butterflies, too, including Monarchs, Black Swallowtails, Sulphurs,  a Common Sootywing, and several unidentified skippers.

Walked the entire way along Sapsucker Woods Road (rather than following trails through part of the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary). At the Lab, stepped into the Morgens Observatory for a quick look at the pond and the Treman Bird-feeding Garden; then stepped back outside, continued north, and entered the Lab at the staff entrance.

The corn in the field along Hanshaw Road averages 3-4 feet tall. I followed the standard route, from home (1462 Hanshaw Road) east to Sapsucker Woods Road, and then north on Sapsucker Woods Road to the border of the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary. Deviations from Sapsucker Woods Road were to the edge of the Briarwood II woods ("Sapsucker Woods South"), up the intended road between 128 and 202 Sapsucker Woods Road; to the end of the service road (leading to the water tower site) just south of Sanctuary Drive; and up the short brush-lined track (former intended road?) between 246 and 254 Sapsucker Woods Road. Visible bird feeders along this route: 1466 Hanshaw Road (back yard), 31 Sapsucker Woods Road (inactive), 222 Sapsucker Woods Road (back yard; inactive), 226 Sapsucker Woods Road (hummingbird and seed feeders under the eaves), 238 Sapsucker Woods Road (feeder down), 81/82 Sanctuary Drive (back yard; down?; visible from the short brush lined track north of Sanctuary Drive), and 260 Sapsucker Woods Road. There also may be feeders at 15 Sapsucker Woods Road, where no feeders are visible from road, but there often are birds here and I suspect feeders. Wednesday.

It was quite breezy, making viewing and hearing birds somewhat difficult except in sheltered areas. There were LOTS of White-throated Sparrows, Red-breasted Nuthatches, and quite a few Purple Finches in the pines and the sheltered swales. There were also some campers, limiting the places I was willing to spish and do screech-owl whistles. At times there were so many birds inthe brush and treetops that actual counting all was impossible. The larger numbers are minimum totals, including some best estimates of large numbers coming in to spishing plus still in the distance calling.

At first glance,it looked like a baby goldfinch! However goldfinch don''t nest until late summer. Too my surprise when placing it under a bush it could fly!!--I could not identify this small bird. It was only about 2" in length, very active little thing. Not afriad though, it came upon a branch and didn''t move,while I looked it over, flew away as I was walking away. It looked like a mature goldfinch? What was this bird?----

The flock seems to be growing larger every night. I twas an amazing sight watching and hearing them all take off at once the sky was full with so many geese. There were also seven deer tonight in the same area they were actually eating from a hay bale the farmer had left in the field for the winter. Doesnt seem to be as many Canada in with the snow geese tonight. Only counted about 15. Checked my two other areas for snow geese none to be found. We will be sad when they finally go. It has been an amazing two weeks watching them.

I saw Nashville Warbler and Northern Parula two years ago in Bermuda. The migrating warblers flitted around, sometimes two or three species to a tree—Parula, Yellow, Black-throated Green, Black-throated Blue, and Redstart—and sometimes eight or nine total.  Saw my first Barn Swallow of the year over the parking lot. A bunch of Brown Creepers—7. Some other nice surprises—three Blue-Gray Gnatcatchers, one of my favorites; Veery, at first I thought it was a Robin, chasing a Robin, but then saw its tawny good looks; a female Rose-breasted Grosbeak; a fiery male Blackburnian Warbler. Kildeer skittered up to truck. Pair feeding, one twittering to other and displaying rusty tail. Squatted once with undertail up.

I entered the area around the "Frog Barn" (91 Sapsucker Woods Road), to as far as the Frog Barn pond. I then returned directly to Sapsucker Woods Road, and walked along the road north to Sapsucker Woods Pond and the Lab. I did not check for feeders at 143 and 151 Sapsucker Woods Road. At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden. Water levels on Sapsucker Woods Pond remain very low, with the scarcity of rain this summer. I stepped back outside the observatory, and continued north, entering the Lab at the staff entrance on the east side of the building. Friday.
