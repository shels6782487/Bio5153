The best observations were of Common Mergansers courting in the protected bay of the Myers marina, 4 males and 1 female performing kick and tail-up displays while vocalizing as well as 3 Gadwall, 2 males and 1 female which were performing an interesting kick display, also vocalizing, (cool nasal honk).  This is the first time I have really had the chance to pay close attention to the COME display and the first time I have seen a GAWA display.

Our original group of six from --Ithaca did a quick trip through the Auto Loop, where, thanks to Mark --Chao''s excellent description, we were able to find three Least Bitterns --in the area across from marker 1 on the Auto Loop.

We were eventually able to watch this bird --for an extended period of time (5 minutes?) as it chased after the --smallest shorebirds.  It seemed to have a single bird singled out and --away from the main flock a few times, but it was never successful in --actually catching anything.  Eventually, it was "escorted" out of the --area by a group of swallows.    --    The final highlight of the evening was a brief appearance of a --COMMON NIGHTHAWK flying over Mays at exactly 8 pm.  Because of a --relatively heavy cloud cover, it was fairly dark at this point, and the --13 GREAT EGRETS that had been in Mays had already left for their roosting --spot (which we decided was somewhere in the direction of Tschache Pool).  --Earlier in the evening, there were also 13 CASPIAN TERNS (including one --juvenile) at Mays.

We were eventually able to watch this bird --for an extended period of time (5 minutes?) as it chased after the --smallest shorebirds.  It seemed to have a single bird singled out and --away from the main flock a few times, but it was never successful in --actually catching anything.  Eventually, it was "escorted" out of the --area by a group of swallows.    --    The final highlight of the evening was a brief appearance of a --COMMON NIGHTHAWK flying over Mays at exactly 8 pm.  Because of a --relatively heavy cloud cover, it was fairly dark at this point, and the --13 GREAT EGRETS that had been in Mays had already left for their roosting --spot (which we decided was somewhere in the direction of Tschache Pool).  --Earlier in the evening, there were also 13 CASPIAN TERNS (including one --juvenile) at Mays.

Mays was mostly full of water on Saturday --morning, but when we arrived yesterday, there were mudflats everywhere!  --There was also a significant influx of new shorebirds at Mays, compared --with what we saw on Saturday morning, and what was reported on Saturday --evening.  Most impressive of all was the presence of 18 BAIRD''S --SANDPIPERS, a total that equals the high count for New York State and --represents a new non-coastal maximum.  The Baird''s Sandpipers were mixed --in with numbers of LEAST, SEMIPALMATED, and PECTORAL SANDPIPERS, and --often afforded great views on the nearest mudflat to the right of the --coral.  Besides the big influx of new Baird''s, other new shorebird --arrivals in the past 24 hours included four SHORT-BILLED DOWITCHERS, three --STILT SANDPIPERS (with one still almost completely barred), one WILSON''S --SNIPE (formerly Common Snipe), and one molting adult BLACK-BELLIED --PLOVER.  GREATER YELLOWLEGS and LESSER YELLOWLEGS were both present, as --were KILLDEER, thirty SEMIPALMATED PLOVERS (~25 adults to 5 juveniles), --and one SPOTTED SANDPIPER.      --    As if these shorebirds weren''t enough, there was a LEAST BITTERN --extravaganza at Montezuma yesterday.  Our original group of six from --Ithaca did a quick trip through the Auto Loop, where, thanks to Mark --Chao''s excellent description, we were able to find three Least Bitterns --in the area across from marker 1 on the Auto Loop.  Two birds were --adults, while the third was a still-partially-downy juvenile bird.  Then, --almost as soon as we arrived at Mays, Mike spotted an immature --BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT-HERON, a GREEN HERON, and a LEAST BITTERN almost in a --row in the canal stretching from Mays Point Pool towards Tschache Pool.  --Eventually, I saw three different Least Bitterns, and I think somebody --might have seen a fourth.  Also in that area, Meena picked out a black --fluffball (this is one of Meena''s specialties) that turned out to be a --VIRGINIA RAIL chick.  Granted, all rail chicks are black fluffballs, but --we felt confident with that identification, since this black fluffball --was accompanied by first one, and then two, adult VIRGINIA RAILS.  --     Alas, before the McGowan boys and Gerard arrived, the seven of us --were treated to a show by a MERLIN that zoomed through Mays several --times.  Meena just made mention a few days ago to locating raptors by the --chatter of swallows in the area, and that was exactly how I first noticed --the presence of the Merlin.  We were eventually able to watch this bird --for an extended period of time (5 minutes?) as it chased after the --smallest shorebirds.  It seemed to have a single bird singled out and --away from the main flock a few times, but it was never successful in --actually catching anything.  Eventually, it was "escorted" out of the --area by a group of swallows.    --    The final highlight of the evening was a brief appearance of a --COMMON NIGHTHAWK flying over Mays at exactly 8 pm.  Because of a --relatively heavy cloud cover, it was fairly dark at this point, and the --13 GREAT EGRETS that had been in Mays had already left for their roosting --spot (which we decided was somewhere in the direction of Tschache Pool).  --Earlier in the evening, there were also 13 CASPIAN TERNS (including one --juvenile) at Mays.

I crossed the road, reentered Sapsucker Woods, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the Podell Boardwalk. At the Lab, stepped into the Morgens Observatory for a quick look at the pond and the Treman Bird-feeding Garden. I then stepped back outside, and continued north. I checked again (and again unsuccessfully) for Virginia Rail in the wetlands between the service entrance and the Lab parking lots. I entered the Lab at the staff entrance. Daylight Saving Time.

I entered the area around the Frog Barn, to the edge of the Frog Barn pond. From the Frog Barn, I walked through the woods along the southwestern segment of the East Trail to Sapsucker Woods Road, crossed the road, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the boardwalk. Water levels high under the boardwalk (higher, at least, than they've been so far this spring.)  At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden. I then went upstairs and viewed the pond again from the observatory on the second floor (between the library and the administration offices). Returning downstairs, I exited through the caterer's entrance, on the east side of the Lab, and continued north, entering the Lab again at the staff entrance at the northeast corner of the building. Thursday. Eastern Daylight Saving Time. Mammals: Eastern Gray Squirrel (1).

I entered the area around the Frog Barn, to the edge of the Frog Barn pond. From the Frog Barn, I walked through the woods along the southwestern segment of the East Trail to Sapsucker Woods Road, crossed the road, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the boardwalk. Water levels high under the boardwalk (higher, at least, than they've been so far this spring.)  At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden. I then went upstairs and viewed the pond again from the observatory on the second floor (between the library and the administration offices). Returning downstairs, I exited through the caterer's entrance, on the east side of the Lab, and continued north, entering the Lab again at the staff entrance at the northeast corner of the building. Thursday. Eastern Daylight Saving Time. Mammals: Eastern Gray Squirrel (1).

Highlights included an Oystercatcher "drama" wherein the quite active chick was temporarily separated from its parents, who spent quite some time running up and down the path and vocalizing (as only AMOYs can do) until the eventual reunion.  One of the younger killdeer chicks was seen with the adults,  at some distance from  spraying activities in their usual area.  One osprey was seen on the platform, then gliding overhead.  More unusually, one of our sharper-eyed birders caught a brief look at three flying bobolinks before they disappeared into the Spartina.

Sapsucker Woods Road and trails through the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary, from the south border of the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary just north of 67 Sapsucker Woods Road (excluding areas outside of the Sanctuary west of Sapsucker Woods Road, from Sanctuary Drive north to 260 Sapsucker Woods Road) north to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. I entered the area around the "Frog Barn" (91 Sapsucker Woods Road), to the edge of the Frog Barn pond (which remains frozen). From the Frog Barn, I returned to Sapsucker Woods Road and continued north along the road to the Lab. At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a quick look at the pond and the bird-feeding garden. The pond is mostly frozen, but the usual open area in front of the observatory (maintained all winter by the bubbler) has expanded greatly in size; the ice elsewhere on the pond is covered with water, making it difficult to identify open areas at a distance. I stepped outside again, continuing north and entering the Lab at the northeast corner of the building. Other bird feeders along this route: 143 Sapsucker Woods Road (suet; seed feeders inactive?), 151 Sapsucker Woods Road. Friday. Civil twilight begins 06:55; sunrise 07:25; sunset 17:13; civil twilight ends 17:43. Eastern Standard Time. Mammals: Eastern Gray Squirrel (11).

Highlights included an Oystercatcher "drama" wherein the quite active chick was temporarily separated from its parents, who spent quite some time running up and down the path and vocalizing (as only AMOYs can do) until the eventual reunion.  One of the younger killdeer chicks was seen with the adults,  at some distance from  spraying activities in their usual area.  One osprey was seen on the platform, then gliding overhead.  More unusually, one of our sharper-eyed birders caught a brief look at three flying bobolinks before they disappeared into the Spartina.

Casual observations while Michi and I took Rufus for a walk. We left home (1462 Hanshaw Road) and headed east on Hanshaw, then south on Freese Road. Just south of Dyce Lab, we turned west on the unpaved track that leads to the east edge of the Equine Research Park woods. At the woods, we turned south until we intersected the track that extends west from Liddell Lab. We headed west, and then, at the edge of the Equine Research Park complex, turned south and entered the woods along Fall Creek (separate eBird checklist). We returned home the same way we came, so the reported distance traveled is only half the distance that we walked. Field conditions: The field along Hanshaw Road, between Bluegrass and Freese, has a grain crop (winter wheat?) that now is over two feet tall. As usual, the small (ca  3.52 acres) field at the corner of Hanshaw and Freese is uncultivated, and is covered in tall grass. Also as usual, the field (ca 5.38 acres) across Freese Road from Dyce Lab is uncultivated; this field is a mix of herbaceous growth, but presumably will be dominated by goldenrod in the fall. The larger field (ca 10.50 acres) just southwest of Dyce Lab (on the west side of Freese Road; bordered to the south by the unpaved track that leads to the Equine Research Park woods), has low growth of a broad-leaved crop, which I don't recognize at this stage. The large (ca 15.87 acres) field to the south of this track (and across Freese Road from the north end of the Freese Community Gardens), which yesterday was tall mix of grass and herbaceous growth, is being cut today. The field (ca 10 acres) across Freese Road from the south end of the Freese Community Gardens (and just north of Liddell Labs) has the same broad-leaved crop as in the field southwest of Dyce Lab. Sunday. Eastern Daylight Saving Time. Mammals: none observed?

I saw a glimpse of blue, and thinking it was a blue jay I casually pointed my binoculars at it. I then realized it was not a blue jay. Remembering from the previous times I have seen bluebirds, I realized it was a bluebird. I double checked with my guides and recorded this sighting on ebird.----I saw the bluebird on a low limb in a cluster of trees just south of Kissena Lake between a grassy hill and marshy area of phragmities.

We also had Ring-necked Ducks here, which moved on by later in the day.

I saw a glimpse of blue, and thinking it was a blue jay I casually pointed my binoculars at it. I then realized it was not a blue jay. Remembering from the previous times I have seen bluebirds, I realized it was a bluebird. I double checked with my guides and recorded this sighting on ebird.----I saw the bluebird on a low limb in a cluster of trees just south of Kissena Lake between a grassy hill and marshy area of phragmities.

Recent flooding forced us to backtrack instead of completing the loop as usual, but there were still many rewarding sightings. Today's highlights, though, were "off-list"--a most unusual bird later ID'd as a presumed escapee White-tailed Diamond Dove, and, for our second diamond, a Diamond-Backed Terrapin seen covering her nest in a wide spot in the gravel trail; DBT's are often seen in the marsh and basking, but none of us had ever encountered one nesting at this location.  Lots of butterflies, too, including Monarchs, Black Swallowtails, Sulphurs,  a Common Sootywing, and several unidentified skippers.

More unusually, one of our sharper-eyed birders caught a brief look at three flying bobolinks before they disappeared into the Spartina.

I should add that there were so many birds overhead that it was very difficult to mentally filter flight calls and look for birds on the ground/ in the trees... Most of the birds on the turf were Savannah Sparrows, with a few Bobolinks and Common Yellowthroats mixed in.  For a few notes on identifying birds visually at night... it can be quite tough to get good looks with the bright stadium lights providing intense unnatural illumination, but we had success in picking out Black-throated Blue Warblers, Canada Warblers, Northern Parulas, Ovenbirds, Magnolia Warblers, and a few others in flight.  However, for every bird I got a nice look at, countless others zipped by as brown and yellow blurs.----I recorded a good portion of the night's flight with a microphone sitting out on top of Mike Harvey's car... apparently the first couple of hours were not saved before my laptop battery died, so I need to work on recovering that file.  However, I have an hour and ten minutes of solid flight call insanity from the end of the evening's "stadium flight". During the majority of this time (11:30 pm - 12:40 am), we were hearing probably over 5 calls per second (potentially quite a few more than that). There was a noticeable dropoff in calling as soon as the lights were turned off, and within 5 minutes of the lights being shut off, we were--hearing single calls perhaps once every 3-5 seconds... the draw that the stadium lights have on migrants seems to be pretty amazing. Throughout the evening we kept hearing odd "tee-tee-tee-tee" calls that sounded reminiscent of both a woodpecker and a shorebird... we figured that they were probably Ruddy Turnstones, and comparison of two calls recorded tonight to turnstone recordings I have on my computer seems to support that.----I was pretty amazed by the number of birds dropping into and around the stadium tonight... highlights for me were the Upland Sandpiper that called as I was getting off my bike just after arriving at the stadium, great looks at the Cape May Warbler, and the mind-blowing flyby male Connecticut Warbler.

I should add that there were so many birds overhead that it was very difficult to mentally filter flight calls and look for birds on the ground/ in the trees... Most of the birds on the turf were Savannah Sparrows, with a few Bobolinks and Common Yellowthroats mixed in.  For a few notes on identifying birds visually at night... it can be quite tough to get good looks with the bright stadium lights providing intense unnatural illumination, but we had success in picking out Black-throated Blue Warblers, Canada Warblers, Northern Parulas, Ovenbirds, Magnolia Warblers, and a few others in flight.  However, for every bird I got a nice look at, countless others zipped by as brown and yellow blurs.----I recorded a good portion of the night's flight with a microphone sitting out on top of Mike Harvey's car... apparently the first couple of hours were not saved before my laptop battery died, so I need to work on recovering that file.  However, I have an hour and ten minutes of solid flight call insanity from the end of the evening's "stadium flight". During the majority of this time (11:30 pm - 12:40 am), we were hearing probably over 5 calls per second (potentially quite a few more than that). There was a noticeable dropoff in calling as soon as the lights were turned off, and within 5 minutes of the lights being shut off, we were--hearing single calls perhaps once every 3-5 seconds... the draw that the stadium lights have on migrants seems to be pretty amazing. Throughout the evening we kept hearing odd "tee-tee-tee-tee" calls that sounded reminiscent of both a woodpecker and a shorebird... we figured that they were probably Ruddy Turnstones, and comparison of two calls recorded tonight to turnstone recordings I have on my computer seems to support that.----I was pretty amazed by the number of birds dropping into and around the stadium tonight... highlights for me were the Upland Sandpiper that called as I was getting off my bike just after arriving at the stadium, great looks at the Cape May Warbler, and the mind-blowing flyby male Connecticut Warbler.  Thanks to the 14+ birders who came out and helped find birds...----TBJ	Small groups of 6-7 SAVANNAH SPARROWS landed in treetops, bleachers and on the field.

It had only a tiny bit of rust in the cheek and white wingbars instead of a more complete white wing patch, but had a yellow throat and breast with fine dark streaks and contrasting whitish undertail coverts. --DJL

However, I have an hour and ten minutes of solid flight call insanity from the end of the evening's "stadium flight". During the majority of this time (11:30 pm - 12:40 am), we were hearing probably over 5 calls per second (potentially quite a few more than that). There was a noticeable dropoff in calling as soon as the lights were turned off, and within 5 minutes of the lights being shut off, we were--hearing single calls perhaps once every 3-5 seconds... the draw that the stadium lights have on migrants seems to be pretty amazing. Throughout the evening we kept hearing odd "tee-tee-tee-tee" calls that sounded reminiscent of both a woodpecker and a shorebird... we figured that they were probably Ruddy Turnstones, and comparison of two calls recorded tonight to turnstone recordings I have on my computer seems to support that.----I was pretty amazed by the number of birds dropping into and around the stadium tonight... highlights for me were the Upland Sandpiper that called as I was getting off my bike just after arriving at the stadium, great looks at the Cape May Warbler, and the mind-blowing flyby male Connecticut Warbler.

I should add that there were so many birds overhead that it was very difficult to mentally filter flight calls and look for birds on the ground/ in the trees... Most of the birds on the turf were Savannah Sparrows, with a few Bobolinks and Common Yellowthroats mixed in.  For a few notes on identifying birds visually at night... it can be quite tough to get good looks with the bright stadium lights providing intense unnatural illumination, but we had success in picking out Black-throated Blue Warblers, Canada Warblers, Northern Parulas, Ovenbirds, Magnolia Warblers, and a few others in flight.  However, for every bird I got a nice look at, countless others zipped by as brown and yellow blurs.----I recorded a good portion of the night's flight with a microphone sitting out on top of Mike Harvey's car... apparently the first couple of hours were not saved before my laptop battery died, so I need to work on recovering that file.  However, I have an hour and ten minutes of solid flight call insanity from the end of the evening's "stadium flight". During the majority of this time (11:30 pm - 12:40 am), we were hearing probably over 5 calls per second (potentially quite a few more than that). There was a noticeable dropoff in calling as soon as the lights were turned off, and within 5 minutes of the lights being shut off, we were--hearing single calls perhaps once every 3-5 seconds... the draw that the stadium lights have on migrants seems to be pretty amazing. Throughout the evening we kept hearing odd "tee-tee-tee-tee" calls that sounded reminiscent of both a woodpecker and a shorebird... we figured that they were probably Ruddy Turnstones, and comparison of two calls recorded tonight to turnstone recordings I have on my computer seems to support that.----I was pretty amazed by the number of birds dropping into and around the stadium tonight... highlights for me were the Upland Sandpiper that called as I was getting off my bike just after arriving at the stadium, great looks at the Cape May Warbler, and the mind-blowing flyby male Connecticut Warbler.

Was joined at the north end of Sapsucker Woods Road by Nate Senner and Mark Chao. Took the standard side jaunts to the end of the service road (leading to the water tower site) just south of Sanctuary Drive, and to the edge of the small pond at the Frog Barn. Walked the entire way along Sapsucker Woods Road (rather than following trails through part of the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary). At the Lab, stepped into the Morgens Observatory for a quick look at the pond and the Treman Bird-feeding Garden; then stepped back outside, continued north, and entered the Lab at the staff entrance. Mammals: house cat (3), White-tailed Deer (2, does), Eastern Chipmunk (6), Red Squirrel (3) Eastern Gray Squirrel (8)

The corn in the field along Hanshaw Road averages 3-4 feet tall. I followed the standard route, from home (1462 Hanshaw Road) east to Sapsucker Woods Road, and then north on Sapsucker Woods Road to the border of the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary. Deviations from Sapsucker Woods Road were to the edge of the Briarwood II woods ("Sapsucker Woods South"), up the intended road between 128 and 202 Sapsucker Woods Road; to the end of the service road (leading to the water tower site) just south of Sanctuary Drive; and up the short brush-lined track (former intended road?) between 246 and 254 Sapsucker Woods Road. Visible bird feeders along this route: 1466 Hanshaw Road (back yard), 31 Sapsucker Woods Road (inactive), 222 Sapsucker Woods Road (back yard; inactive), 226 Sapsucker Woods Road (hummingbird and seed feeders under the eaves), 238 Sapsucker Woods Road (feeder down), 81/82 Sanctuary Drive (back yard; down?; visible from the short brush lined track north of Sanctuary Drive), and 260 Sapsucker Woods Road. There also may be feeders at 15 Sapsucker Woods Road, where no feeders are visible from road, but there often are birds here and I suspect feeders. Wednesday.

I should add that there were so many birds overhead that it was very difficult to mentally filter flight calls and look for birds on the ground/ in the trees... Most of the birds on the turf were Savannah Sparrows, with a few Bobolinks and Common Yellowthroats mixed in.  For a few notes on identifying birds visually at night... it can be quite tough to get good looks with the bright stadium lights providing intense unnatural illumination, but we had success in picking out Black-throated Blue Warblers, Canada Warblers, Northern Parulas, Ovenbirds, Magnolia Warblers, and a few others in flight.  However, for every bird I got a nice look at, countless others zipped by as brown and yellow blurs.----I recorded a good portion of the night's flight with a microphone sitting out on top of Mike Harvey's car... apparently the first couple of hours were not saved before my laptop battery died, so I need to work on recovering that file.

However, for every bird I got a nice look at, countless others zipped by as brown and yellow blurs.----I recorded a good portion of the night's flight with a microphone sitting out on top of Mike Harvey's car... apparently the first couple of hours were not saved before my laptop battery died, so I need to work on recovering that file.  However, I have an hour and ten minutes of solid flight call insanity from the end of the evening's "stadium flight". During the majority of this time (11:30 pm - 12:40 am), we were hearing probably over 5 calls per second (potentially quite a few more than that). There was a noticeable dropoff in calling as soon as the lights were turned off, and within 5 minutes of the lights being shut off, we were--hearing single calls perhaps once every 3-5 seconds... the draw that the stadium lights have on migrants seems to be pretty amazing. Throughout the evening we kept hearing odd "tee-tee-tee-tee" calls that sounded reminiscent of both a woodpecker and a shorebird... we figured that they were probably Ruddy Turnstones, and comparison of two calls recorded tonight to turnstone recordings I have on my computer seems to support that.----I was pretty amazed by the number of birds dropping into and around the stadium tonight... highlights for me were the Upland Sandpiper that called as I was getting off my bike just after arriving at the stadium, great looks at the Cape May Warbler, and the mind-blowing flyby male Connecticut Warbler.

One individual was observed swimming and diving alone.  The bird was obviously loon-shaped with a large, dark, dagger-like bill, large head and thick neck.  Body was large and dark above, white below.  It was about twice as large as nearby American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes).  ----The head was large, thought quite rounded relative to the squared-off, blocky heads of Common Loons (Gavia immer).  The forehead slopped gently into the culmen, not steep like on Common Loon.  The bill was smaller than Common Loons with less of a noticeable gonydeal angle.  ----Overall, the bird was dark gray above, white below.  Bill was gray.  Head, and especially the nape, was a ghostly silver-gray color, obviously paler than the crown and back.  The back was dark gray with obvious pale feather-edging.  A faint, but noticeable dark chin-strip was observed.  The neck line demarcating the dark dorsal and white ventral colors was sharp and straight.  There was no noticeable indentation of white as seen on Common Loons.  Dark feathers were observed all along the bird's flanks at the water's edge.  No white was visible as would be expected on an Arctic Loon (Gavia arctica). ----The bird was actively diving, staying under for about 30 seconds at a time.  It would surface for about 15 seconds, often many tens of meters from the previous dive location.  The diving style was quite different than what I am used to with Common Loons.  The bird would lunge quite high out of the water and make a big arch with its neck into the water.  In my experience, Common Loons tend to dip into water without such a concerted lunging effort.  No vocalizations were heard.  The bird was not seen flying or flapping/stretching it's wings. ----[Text copied from my NYSARC report.]

It was quite breezy, making viewing and hearing birds somewhat difficult except in sheltered areas. There were LOTS of White-throated Sparrows, Red-breasted Nuthatches, and quite a few Purple Finches in the pines and the sheltered swales. There were also some campers, limiting the places I was willing to spish and do screech-owl whistles. At times there were so many birds inthe brush and treetops that actual counting all was impossible. The larger numbers are minimum totals, including some best estimates of large numbers coming in to spishing plus still in the distance calling.

It was quite breezy, making viewing and hearing birds somewhat difficult except in sheltered areas. There were LOTS of White-throated Sparrows, Red-breasted Nuthatches, and quite a few Purple Finches in the pines and the sheltered swales. There were also some campers, limiting the places I was willing to spish and do screech-owl whistles. At times there were so many birds inthe brush and treetops that actual counting all was impossible. The larger numbers are minimum totals, including some best estimates of large numbers coming in to spishing plus still in the distance calling.

I should add that there were so many birds overhead that it was very difficult to mentally filter flight calls and look for birds on the ground/ in the trees... Most of the birds on the turf were Savannah Sparrows, with a few Bobolinks and Common Yellowthroats mixed in.  For a few notes on identifying birds visually at night... it can be quite tough to get good looks with the bright stadium lights providing intense unnatural illumination, but we had success in picking out Black-throated Blue Warblers, Canada Warblers, Northern Parulas, Ovenbirds, Magnolia Warblers, and a few others in flight.  However, for every bird I got a nice look at, countless others zipped by as brown and yellow blurs.----I recorded a good portion of the night's flight with a microphone sitting out on top of Mike Harvey's car... apparently the first couple of hours were not saved before my laptop battery died, so I need to work on recovering that file.  However, I have an hour and ten minutes of solid flight call insanity from the end of the evening's "stadium flight". During the majority of this time (11:30 pm - 12:40 am), we were hearing probably over 5 calls per second (potentially quite a few more than that). There was a noticeable dropoff in calling as soon as the lights were turned off, and within 5 minutes of the lights being shut off, we were--hearing single calls perhaps once every 3-5 seconds... the draw that the stadium lights have on migrants seems to be pretty amazing. Throughout the evening we kept hearing odd "tee-tee-tee-tee" calls that sounded reminiscent of both a woodpecker and a shorebird... we figured that they were probably Ruddy Turnstones, and comparison of two calls recorded tonight to turnstone recordings I have on my computer seems to support that.----I was pretty amazed by the number of birds dropping into and around the stadium tonight... highlights for me were the Upland Sandpiper that called as I was getting off my bike just after arriving at the stadium, great looks at the Cape May Warbler, and the mind-blowing flyby male Connecticut Warbler.

I entered the area around the "Frog Barn" (91 Sapsucker Woods Road), to as far as the Frog Barn pond. From the Frog Barn, I walked through the woods along the southwestern segment of the East Trail to Sapsucker Woods Road, crossed the road, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the boardwalk. At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden. I then stepped back outside the observatory and continued north, entering the Lab again at the staff entrance on the east side of the building. Thursday.

At first glance,it looked like a baby goldfinch! However goldfinch don''t nest until late summer. Too my surprise when placing it under a bush it could fly!!--I could not identify this small bird. It was only about 2" in length, very active little thing. Not afriad though, it came upon a branch and didn''t move,while I looked it over, flew away as I was walking away. It looked like a mature goldfinch? What was this bird?----

There was a noticeable dropoff in calling as soon as the lights were turned off, and within 5 minutes of the lights being shut off, we were--hearing single calls perhaps once every 3-5 seconds... the draw that the stadium lights have on migrants seems to be pretty amazing. Throughout the evening we kept hearing odd "tee-tee-tee-tee" calls that sounded reminiscent of both a woodpecker and a shorebird... we figured that they were probably Ruddy Turnstones, and comparison of two calls recorded tonight to turnstone recordings I have on my computer seems to support that.----I was pretty amazed by the number of birds dropping into and around the stadium tonight... highlights for me were the Upland Sandpiper that called as I was getting off my bike just after arriving at the stadium, great looks at the Cape May Warbler, and the mind-blowing flyby male Connecticut Warbler.

There are shallow puddles (now frozen?) scattered across the field. The wheat in the field was harvested in mid July, leaving 6-12 inches of stubble, weeds, and grass in the field. Ground bare (no snow cover) when we began our walk, but there was a dusting of snow on the ground by the time that we returned to the house. Ponds (just north of Liddell Lab, and the small pond by the Equine Research Park) are open. Deciduous trees are bare. Casual observations while taking Rufus for a walk. We left home (1462 Hanshaw Road) and crossed south across the field to the northeast corner of the Equine Research Park woods. We walked along the eastern border of the woods; at the southeastern corner we turned east and walked southeast to view the pond just north of Liddell Lab. We then continued west along the east/west track that extends from Freese Road (at Liddell Lab) to the Equine Research Park, and walked west through the research park. We continued on north to Bluegrass Lane. At the northwest corner of the horse paddocks we turned east and walked along the north edge of the woods, before crossing the field back to the house. Sunday. Civil twilight begins 06:08; sunrise 06:36; sunset 18:00; civil twilight ends 18:28. Eastern Standard Time. Mammals: none observed.

I entered the area around the "Frog Barn" (91 Sapsucker Woods Road), to as far as the Frog Barn pond. From the Frog Barn, I walked through the woods along the southwestern segment of the East Trail to Sapsucker Woods Road, crossed the road, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the boardwalk. At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden. I then stepped back outside the observatory and continued north, entering the Lab again at the staff entrance on the east side of the building. Monday.

We spent some time at the beginning observing the gradual resurrection of an Ovenbird that (we presume) had been stunned by flying against a window at the Center. The tide was high - lots of mud on the West side of the bay. The highlight were probably the Clapper Rail that was observed by the faithful remnant who returned to the bridge at the end of the walk, and the Kingfisher that did several flybys for our viewing.

Few other waterfowl today and fewer Common Loons than yesterday.  Slight uptick in overhead passerines.  Bob Spahn joined for the last 45 min or so and was there when I left.

We spent some time at the beginning observing the gradual resurrection of an Ovenbird that (we presume) had been stunned by flying against a window at the Center. The tide was high - lots of mud on the West side of the bay. The highlight were probably the Clapper Rail that was observed by the faithful remnant who returned to the bridge at the end of the walk, and the Kingfisher that did several flybys for our viewing.

It''s a wooded area along the Paumanok Path, comprised mostly of oak trees. The area had been hit pretty hard by Gypsey Moths--a few years ago, so there is an abundance of diseased and dead trees for the bird to forage on and roost in.

The cat was off in a weed patch in an area screened from neighboring houses by bushes. Picking at its eyes? When I turned the car around to get a better look, the bird flew away. I guess it's entitled but it makes you sad about somebody's pet.

TIME: 7-9am. WEATHER: Foggy with clouds 50 F, W wind less than 5 mph. In my notes I mention hearing a possible Virginia Rail give the "kit-ki-dit" call from the phragmites to the west of the West End turnaround. My notes say that I am not 100% sure of the identification as it only called once and Chris Jager did not hear it. This would be a NY state bird, but I will be conservative and refrain from including it.

The Orchard Oriole flew onto the rock below the castle. We (Denis and myself) were looking down at the bird. Over the next 15 minutes we got some excellent, looking down views without intervening foliage, as it foraged.----At 9:04p a Black Skimmer arrived on Turtle Pond.

One adult seen feeding on a deer carcass about 200 yards out on the reservoir. It was feeding when I arrived and continued to until 11:07 pm. I did not see the eagle leave but at 11:15 pm I saw the eagle perched on the same white pine I had seen an eagle perched on yesterday. The eagle was actively feeding the whole time It was at the carcass. It would move around the cascade tugging at it here and there and also rip hair and pieces of hide off it. One to 3 crows were on the ground near the eagle and were apparently picking of scraps and cawing.

Robins flying, and tried to keep track of count.  They were not in big flocks, but small groups, of 1, 3, 4, 1, 14, 7, 1.  Chickadee flew over just as we left the house, heard a crow.  Checked out Sarahpark, and nothing there, but as we got out on Sunset Meadow, 21 Canada geese flew from east to west in a single string.  Wasted a few minutes on a pair of starlings in OKP.  They were so far away, was trying to establish them as flickers, but turned out to be starlings.  Three crows were feeding in Long Meadow, when out of nowhere a crow appeared to be fleeing from an immature Northern Harrier, but it turned out they were just going in the same direction.  Crow flew on, hawk lit, crows in field were unconcerned.  On way home, heard a towhee in Sarahpark.  Birds were active there but couldn''t id any except the towhee who posed on a dead branch and called.  A couple of chickadees flew over, and a wren was playing on the fence around the oval.

Robins flying, and tried to keep track of count.  They were not in big flocks, but small groups, of 1, 3, 4, 1, 14, 7, 1.  Chickadee flew over just as we left the house, heard a crow.  Checked out Sarahpark, and nothing there, but as we got out on Sunset Meadow, 21 Canada geese flew from east to west in a single string.  Wasted a few minutes on a pair of starlings in OKP.  They were so far away, was trying to establish them as flickers, but turned out to be starlings.  Three crows were feeding in Long Meadow, when out of nowhere a crow appeared to be fleeing from an immature Northern Harrier, but it turned out they were just going in the same direction.  Crow flew on, hawk lit, crows in field were unconcerned.  On way home, heard a towhee in Sarahpark.  Birds were active there but couldn''t id any except the towhee who posed on a dead branch and called.  A couple of chickadees flew over, and a wren was playing on the fence around the oval.

In addition to Pine Grosbeaks and a few other nice surprises, there was an amazing movement of Canada Geese afoot. We noticed them after lunch only moving in a constant stream of hundreds coming across the lake and down from the NE. The only other species that showed obvious migratioon was Great Blue Heron--we saw about 6 that were flying high and clearly moving in this first major cold snap of the year.  WEATHER: Very cold (20-25 F), with strong (15-25 mph NW wind in exposed areas). Moderate snow in morning but clea for much of mid-day. A winter storm arriving that evening was probably part of the trigger of bird movement.

I saw Nashville Warbler and Northern Parula two years ago in Bermuda. The migrating warblers flitted around, sometimes two or three species to a tree—Parula, Yellow, Black-throated Green, Black-throated Blue, and Redstart—and sometimes eight or nine total.  Saw my first Barn Swallow of the year over the parking lot. A bunch of Brown Creepers—7. Some other nice surprises—three Blue-Gray Gnatcatchers, one of my favorites; Veery, at first I thought it was a Robin, chasing a Robin, but then saw its tawny good looks; a female Rose-breasted Grosbeak; a fiery male Blackburnian Warbler. Kildeer skittered up to truck. Pair feeding, one twittering to other and displaying rusty tail. Squatted once with undertail up.

Birdsong, especially of Yellow Warblers, Red-Winged Blackbirds, and Northern Cardinals, filled the air, as did the heady scent of Autumn Olive blooms. Gorgeous Baltimore Oriole males seemed to be everywhere, some gathering nesting materials, and at least one cardinal chick was seen, hopping around its nest, under the watchful eye of Mom & Dad.  Special treats were our reunion with the Gerrittsen kildeer and the appearance of many butterflies, including Common Buckeyes, American Ladies, Red Admirals, and an extraordinary number of Eastern Tailed Blues, all posing for Mohammed''s camera.  Speaking of reunions, we were pleased to have Tom, on morning leave from baby Charlie, joining us on our walk, and finding us "good birds."

I entered the area around the "Frog Barn" (91 Sapsucker Woods Road), to as far as the Frog Barn pond. I then returned directly to Sapsucker Woods Road, and walked along the road north to Sapsucker Woods Pond and the Lab. I did not check for feeders at 143 and 151 Sapsucker Woods Road. At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a look at the pond and the bird feeding garden. Water levels on Sapsucker Woods Pond remain very low, with the scarcity of rain this summer. I stepped back outside the observatory, and continued north, entering the Lab at the staff entrance on the east side of the building. Friday.

Scattered through, a few Bonaparte''s Gulls and Common Terns. The Forster''s Tern was first thing, headed east, where most birds were headed west.--    The swallow count is only birds going west and is again based on several 1 minute counts through the period averaged and then used with approx. percentages of migrants to reach totals. Suggests that yesterday''s estimates without counts were WAY LOW. Actually more swallows were headed east at each count period, but almost all of those were Bank, probably from the Devil''s Nose colony. Bigger percentage of Barn Swallows today, but actually more were going behind crossing the parking lot each time I headed out there than were in front, so not part of the total.----    Finally!!! a color-banded Caspian Tern on the beach!--

Widespread frost on the ground. Civil twilight begins 06:34; sunrise 07:05.  Leaves of deciduous trees in the area are mostly bare. Sapsucker Woods Road and trails through the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary, from the south border of the Sapsucker Woods Sanctuary just north of 67 Sapsucker Woods Road (excluding areas outside of the Sanctuary west of Sapsucker Woods Road, from Sanctuary Drive north to 260 Sapsucker Woods Road) north to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. I entered the area around the "Frog Barn" (91 Sapsucker Woods Road), to the edge of the Frog Barn pond. From the Frog Barn, I walked through the woods along the southwestern segment of the East Trail to Sapsucker Woods Road. I crossed the road, reentered the woods, and continued along the eastern segments of the Severinghaus and Wilson trails, including the boardwalk. Water levels on Sapsucker Woods Pond remain high (according to Charles Eldermire, the outlet to the pond is blocked, perhaps by a beaver); there is a thin crust of ice on the water in the back (southern) portions of the pond, especially in the wooded portion near the road. At the Lab, I stepped into the observatory for a quick look at the pond and the bird-feeding garden. I then stepped back and continued north, entering the Lab at the staff entrance at the northeast corner of the building. Tuesday. Eastern Standard Time. Mammals: Eastern Gray Squirrel (1), Red Squirrel (1).

Birdsong, especially of Yellow Warblers, Red-Winged Blackbirds, and Northern Cardinals, filled the air, as did the heady scent of Autumn Olive blooms. Gorgeous Baltimore Oriole males seemed to be everywhere, some gathering nesting materials, and at least one cardinal chick was seen, hopping around its nest, under the watchful eye of Mom & Dad.  Special treats were our reunion with the Gerrittsen kildeer and the appearance of many butterflies, including Common Buckeyes, American Ladies, Red Admirals, and an extraordinary number of Eastern Tailed Blues, all posing for Mohammed''s camera.  Speaking of reunions, we were pleased to have Tom, on morning leave from baby Charlie, joining us on our walk, and finding us "good birds."
